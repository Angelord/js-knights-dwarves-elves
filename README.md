## Javascript Board Game


### About
A board game written in javascript. Rendering is done using html canvas. 


### How to Play
Drag and drop your unit to move or attack. Blue means you can move to a tile, whilst red means you
can attack the enemy on that tile. Black tiles are obstacles, which you can also attack and destroy.
You can also use a potion to heal a unit once per turn. This is done by dragging and droping the potion
on the unit you wish to heal. Using the potion has a random chance of ending your turn.

For a more detailed description of the rules refer to the design document (Only in bulgarian - sorry).


### How to Run
Simply open index.html with your browser.
